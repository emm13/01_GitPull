# Commands to initiate a pull request for another's code on Git
#----------------------------------------------------------------

    # Load Git on Unix terminal
    > module load git
    > git

    # Change into working directory
    > cd 01_Code/Git/
    
 
    # Ask for help on commands such as 'add' and 'push'
    > git add -help
    > git push -help
    
    # Copy code from your online repository to local Unix repository
    > git clone https://github.com/emm13/deconstructSigs.git

    # Make modifications to your script and save it
    # I added the parameter 'bsg' to 'mut.to.sigs.input.R' 
    > nano mut.to.sigs.input.R
    
    # Add your modified code to the local repository
    > git add mut.to.sigs.input.R
    
    # Check the status of your repository now that a file has been modified
    > git status
    
    # Commit your changes to your local repository with an explanation of the change
    > git commit mut.to.sigs.input.R -m "Adding parameter 'bsg' to make code accessible to earlier genome builds such as hg18"
    
    # Get a shorthand link to your online repository using 'remote'
    # Remote gives you the online location as well as acronym you can use to make life easier.
    
    > git remote -v

    # Output from remote looks like this
    # _origin_ is the acronym in the example below and 'https://github.com/emm13/deconstructSigs.git' is the link is to my online repository
    # You can use the acronym 'origin' for both fetch and push commands
    #	origin  https://github.com/emm13/01_GitPull.git (fetch)
    #	origin  https://github.com/emm13/01_GitPull.git (push)

    # You can also create a shorthand for another person's repository if you are intending to submit your pull request to the directly from Unix
    # rather than from your online repository
   
    > git remote add decons https://github.com/raerose01/deconstructSigs

    # When you rerun 'remote', here's what you get - all the links you might want to use to push/pull/fetch
    # 'decons' is the other person's repository and 'origin' is mine

    # > git remote -v
    # decons  https://github.com/raerose01/deconstructSigs (fetch)
    # decons  https://github.com/raerose01/deconstructSigs (push)
    # origin  https://github.com/emm13/01_GitPull.git (fetch)
    # origin  https://github.com/emm13/01_GitPull.git (push)

# Sync your changes to your online repository and
# 1. Initiate a pull request online
# 2. Initiate a pull request directly from Unix

    # Push your local changes onto your online repository
    > git push

    # 1. Online pull request
    # The rest of the steps, 15-20 are available at https://github.com/emm13/01_GitPull/blob/master/README.md
    
    # 2. Local pull request
    > git request-pull master https://github.com/emm13/01_GitPull
